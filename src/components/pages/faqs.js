        p > Farmers ' Rights are basically about enabling farmers to continue their work as stewards and innovators of agricultural biodiversity, and about recognizing and rewarding them for their contribution to the global pool of genetic resources. Farmers'
        Rights are addressed in the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources
        for Food and Agriculture, but are not defined there.However, measures to protect and promote these rights are suggested, including the protection of traditional knowledge relevant to crop genetic resources, the right of farmers to equitably participate in the sharing of benefits arising from the utilization of crop genetic resources, and the right to participate in decision making processes at the national level on matters related to the conservation and sustainable use of these resources.Farmers ' Rights to save, use, exchange and sell farm-saved seed and propagating material are also addressed. < /p> < /
